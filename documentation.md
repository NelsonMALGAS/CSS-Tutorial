# CSS Explanation

## The CSS begins with a reset to ensure consistent styling across browsers by setting box-sizing, margin, and padding to zero for all elements.

## The body is styled to use Arial as the default font, have a light gray background, and center its contents using flexbox.

## The *.container* class defines a centered, white background container with padding, border radius, and a subtle box shadow.

## Form elements *(.signup-form, .form-control, label, input)* are styled for clarity, readability, and responsiveness.

## The submit button is styled with a dark blue background, white text, padding, border-radius, and changes color on hover.

## Media queries adjust the *.container* width to 100% on screens narrower than 600px, ensuring responsiveness.(@media)
