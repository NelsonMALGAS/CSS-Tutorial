# Mini Tutorial: Understanding JavaScript Basics
1. JavaScript Engines
JavaScript engines like V8 power the execution of JavaScript code in browsers. They take JavaScript source code and convert it into executable machine code. Key engines include V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari).

2. JavaScript Syntax
Expressions and statements are fundamental to JavaScript syntax:

Expressions: Produce values. Examples include arithmetic expressions (2 + 3), function calls (myFunction()), and object literals ({ key: value }).

Statements: Perform actions. Examples include variable declarations (let x = 5;), loops (for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {}), and conditionals (if (condition) {} else {}).

3. Lexical Structure
JavaScript's lexical rules define how code is written:

Variables: Declared with var, let, or const.
Functions: Declared with function keyword.
Objects: Created with {}.
Arrays: Created with [].
Comments: Single-line with // or multi-line with /* */.
Whitespace: Ignored except where it separates tokens.
4. Syntax-Engine Interaction
JavaScript syntax is parsed and interpreted by the engine:

Parsing: Converts code into a structure that the engine can understand.
Execution: Interprets parsed code, generating output or actions based on it.
Optimization: Engines like V8 optimize code for performance during execution.
5. Error Handling Skills
Identify and fix JavaScript errors:

Syntax Errors: Detected during parsing (e.g., missing semicolon).
Runtime Errors: Occur during execution (e.g., undefined variable).
Logic Errors: Code runs but produces incorrect results.
